Advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript:
-- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
-- TypeScript has additional features, which do not exists in current version of JavaScript supported by most browsers.
-- TypeScript is strongly (static) typed. But JavaScript is dynamically typed.
-- User has to explicitly specify the type of the variables.
-- TypeScript has object oriented features that we do not have in JavaScript yet.
-- With TypeScript, we can catch errors at compile time instead of run time.
